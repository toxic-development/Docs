# FiveM2Discord

Simple resource that allows you to have server notifications sent to a discord channel using webhooks!

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Due to FiveM's active caching it is not recommended to make changes to **any** resources when the server is online.
    However you can get away with it for most smaller resources!
