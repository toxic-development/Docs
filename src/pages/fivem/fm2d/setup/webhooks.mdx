## Add your webhooks

<Steps>
         <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
            If you want System Infos, Killing Logs and Chat in three separate channels, replace the webhooks links 
            I have in lines `1`, `2` & `3` with the webhooks link for each individual channel. 
            Otherwise, create just one Webhook and replace these 3 lines with that webhook
         </Callout>

         ### Create a webhook
         If you haven't done so already head over to the [Create a webhook](/fivem/fm2d/setup/webhooks#create-a-webhook).

         ### Paste your webhook url(s)
         Open the `server/s_config.lua` file using `visual studio code`, `node pad` or whatever you prefer
         and add your webhook(s) to their respective lines (see example config below).

         <Callout>
            If you do not want to use any of these logs simply leave their values empty.
         </Callout>

         ```lua filename="server/s_config.lua" {3}
          S_CONFIG = {
            DiscordServerLogs: 'WEBHOOK_LINK_HERE' --[[ Used for server logs like joins and leaves ]]
            DiscordKillingLogs: 'WEBHOOK_LINK_HERE' --[[ Used for kill logs like when a player dies or commits suicide ]]
            DiscordWebhookChat: 'WEBHOOK_LINK_HERE' --[[ User for logging in game chat messages (if configured) ]]
          }
         ```

         ### Save and profit
         When you have edited the config to your liking you can save and close it.
