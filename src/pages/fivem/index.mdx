# Introduction

Welcome, here you can find guides, documentation and use cases for all of our
fivem related projects, scripts and resources!

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Due to FiveM's active caching it is not recommended to make changes to **any** resources when the server is online.
    However you can get away with it for most smaller resources!
