# About FiveM (CitizenFX)

FiveM is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V
enabling you to play multiplayer on customized
dedicated servers, powered by Cfx.re.

### Streaming

FiveM allows servers to use custom cars, maps, weapons, and more dynamically.

### AI

FiveM allows servers to keep the original game AI, so you'll never be alone. You can also PvE!

### Standalone

FiveM doesn't modify your GTA V installation, so you can switch between GTA:O and FiveM without getting banned.

### Sync quality

FiveM uses Rockstar's network code with improvements, so you'll have the best sync around.
